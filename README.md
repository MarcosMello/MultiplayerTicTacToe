# MultiplayerTicTacToe
## Multiplayer TicTacToe that I'm trying to develop using only Python.
For this project I'm using:
* Tkinter
===========================
Until now, I've only really worked on the GUI part of the Client. I've started 
to work on the Server, but stopped before doing anything significant.
